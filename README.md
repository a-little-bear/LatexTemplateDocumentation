# Introduction

This is a latex template for homework / note taking. The main feature of this template is the tcolorboxes with different colors, and ending symbols. Moreover, the abbreviations of all these tcolor theorem boxes environments help the user effectively records notes during lectures.

Furthermore, there are some additional packages designed for specific courses, e.g., MAT240, CSC240.

In addition, the custimized cover page and background color (night mode with background image) further increase the beauty of the document.

Overall, this eye-protecting template effectively helps the users to record notes especially for STEM related subjects.
